SGA - String Graph Assembler

SGA is a de novo assembler for DNA sequence reads. It is based on Gene Myers' string graph
formulation of assembly and uses the FM-index/Burrows-Wheeler transform to efficiently
find overlaps between sequence reads. The core algorithms are described in this paper:

*** Compiling SGA

SGA requires:
    -google sparse hash library (http://code.google.com/p/google-sparsehash/)
    -zlib (http://www.zlib.net/)

If these libraries are installed, to compile SGA first run configure then make:

./configure
./make

The path to the sparse hash library can be specified as follows:

./configure CPPFLAGS=-I/home/jsimpson/include

Running make install will install sga into /usr/local/bin/ by default. To specify the install
location use the --prefix option to configure:

./configure --prefix=/home/jsimpson/ && make && make install

This command will copy sga to /home/jsimpson/bin/sga

*** Running SGA

SGA consists of a number of subprograms, together which form the assembly pipeline. The subprograms
can also be used to perform other interesting tasks, like read error correction or removing PCR duplicates.
Each program and subprogram will print a brief description and its usage instructions if the --help flag is used.

To get a listing of all subprograms, run sga --help.

The major subprograms are:

* sga preprocess READS > out.fastq

Prepare reads for assembly. It can perform optional quality filtering/trimming. By default
it will discard reads that have uncalled bases ('N' or '.'). If you wish to keep these reads, use the --permuteN 
flag which will randomly change any uncalled bases to one of [ACGT]. It is mandatory to run this command 
on real data. 

If your reads are paired, the --pe-mode 1 option should be specified. The paired reads can be input in two 
files (sga preprocess READS1 READS2) where the first read in READS1 is paired with the first read on READS2 
and so on. Alternatively, they can be specified in a single file where the two reads are expected to appear 
in consecutive records. By default, output is written to stdout.

* sga index READS

Build the FM-index for READS, which is a fasta or fastq file. The -d option can be used to limit
the amount of memory consumed at the cost of higher running time. Typical values of -d are 2000000 or 4000000.
This program is threaded (-t N).

* sga correct READS

Perform error correction on READS file. Overlap and kmer-based correction algorithms
are implemented. By default, a hybrid algorithm is used which first attempts to correct the reads
using long kmers. This method of correction is fast and will get rid of most singleton errors. 
The reads that cannot be corrected using kmers are corrected by finding inexact overlaps 
from which a multiple alignment and consensus sequence is computed. Any remaining uncorrected
reads can be discarded by specifying the --discard flag. 

Many options exist for this program, see --help. Substantially improved results can be found
by changing the --min-overlap, --error-rate, --kmer-size and --kmer-threshold parameters. This program
is threaded (-t N). By default, the corrected reads will be output to READS.ec.fa. 

* sga rmdup READS

Remove duplicate sequences from READS file. This is useful for removing PCR/optical duplicates. 
The --error-rate parameter controls the edit percentage that is allowed to consider two reads to be identical.
This program automatically regenerates the FM-index without the duplicated reads.

* sga overlap -m N READS

Find overlaps between reads to construct the string graph. The -m parameter specifies
the minimum length of the overlaps to find. By default only non-transitive (irreducible) edges are output and edges
between identical sequences. If all overlaps between reads are desired, the --exhaustive option can be specified.
This program is threaded. The output file is READS.asqg.gz by default.

* sga assemble READS.asqg.gz

Assemble takes the output of the overlap step and constructs contigs. The output is in contigs.fa by default. Options
exist for cleaning the graph before assembly which will substantially increase assembly continuity. 
See the --trim, --bubble, --resolve-small options.

*** Workflow examples 

Refer to the wiki on the sga github page for usage examples.

*** Data quality issues

Sequence assembly requires high quality data. It is worth assessing the quality of your reads
using tools like FastQC (http://www.bioinformatics.bbsrc.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) to help guide the choice
of assembly parameters. Low-quality data should be filtered or trimmed.

Very highly-represented sequences (>1000X) can cause problems for SGA. This can happen when sequencing a small genome
or when mitochondria or other contamination is present in the sequencing run. In these cases, it is worth considering
pre-filtering the data or running an initial 'rmdup' step before error correction.

*** History 

The first SGA code check-in was August, 2009. The algorithms for directly constructing the string graph from
the FM-index were developed and implemented in the fall of 2009. The initial public release was October 2010.

*** Third party code

SGA uses Bentley and Sedgwick's multikey quicksort code that can be found here: http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs/strings/demo.c
It also uses zlib, the google sparse hash and gzstream by Deepak Bandyopadhyay and Lutz Kettner (see Thirdparty/README)
