# Assembly graph format specification version 0.1
#

Motivation

The dominant paradigms for sequence assembly are overlap/string graphs (see Myers) and de Bruijn graphs (see Pevzner). Here we define a common file format to unify work in the field of sequence assembly and allow developers to work on algorithms within a common framework. 

A sequence graph is described by a set of vertices {V} and edges {E}. Here we use Myer's formulation of a string graph as the basis for this format. 

==================
File specification
==================

An assembly graph format file is an ascii-encoded text file similar to a fasta file. The file is split into two sections, a VERTEX specification section followed by an EDGE specification section.

-------
Header
-------
-optional

Type:
HD - header
	VN	File format version
	VT	Number of vertices?
	ED	Number of edges?
	TP	Graph type (stringgraph? debruijn?)

PG - program
	ID	Program name
	VN	Program version
	CL	Command line

--------
Vertex section
--------

V - vertex
	ID	Vertex name (must be unique)
	LN	Sequence length
	CV	Total read (kmer?) coverage of the vertex
	1 to n sequence lines follow

-----
Edge section
-----

E <ID1> <ID2> <ID1.START ID1.END> <ID2.START ID2.END>

deBruijn edges are a specialization of this were (END - START + 1) = k for all edges
and either START = 0 or END = |v_i| ("extreme" - myers)

string graph - are the edges req'd to be extreme?
It is convenient to describe the relative direction 


===================
Scaffold data
===================

SF
	ID	Scaffold ID
	CM	Number of components
		CI	Contig ID
		DS	Distance from last
		OR	Orientation wrt last
